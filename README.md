## Remarks
The first draft was built as a static website. Firstly, the html broiler plate or the html base was written to give it structure.
After that, the page was styled one section at a time in a hiererchial manner. This way consistency was maintained.
After the first initial design was completed, new feature changes were added slowly at a time. As rushing could result in merge
conflicts. Final version was completed with simple, modern and elegant design with minimal animations while implementing
various topics covered during the LAB classes.

**About Design**
The design was inspired by japanese cafe posters, and graphics designes with minimalistic vibes. The main purpose of this
project is to demonstrate skills in html and css and their various topics. 

**About resources and refferences**
The following resources and refferences were used during the development as aid :
- Youtube (for implementations, learning purposes)
- Pinterest (for design references)
- ChatGpt (for advice and explainations, learning purposes)
- Textbook (for topics covered)
